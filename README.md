Yo, fam! Get hyped for the coding revolution with Yeetcode! This ain't your grandma's Python; we're on a whole new level. Picture macros, slang, and code that's lit AF. Drop the basic syntax, grab your hypebeast IDE, and let's kick off this coding party.

Coding doesn't have to be a bore. Spice up your programs with `fire`, `sus`, and `bruh_moments` to keep it real and let your inner meme lord shine. Describe your code's moves using impactful verbs like `slay` `crush`, and `bamboozle`. It's all about capturing those ✨vibes✨ man.

Sure, it might induce a cringe or two, but Yeetcode is just a draft, and your feedback is the key! Let's craft a programming language that's both lit and legit. Peace out.

## Features
This is just a fancy way of understanding decorators(and maybe some metaprogramming concepts). I will try expand more on this, but till now, this is what I have(these are just substitutions) : 
| Original Builtin | Sassy-fied Substitute |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| `print`     | `show_dat`     |
| `abs`       | `hype_check`   |
| `range`     | `levels`       |
| `input`     | `spill_the_tea`|
| `min`       | `lowkey`       |
| `max`       | `peak`         |
| `sum`       | `stacks`       |
| `help`      | `welp`         |
| `delattr`   | `ded`          |
| `type`      | `vibe_check`   |
| `enumerate` | `roll_call`    |

## Further Development
I initially planned on developing a whole new programming language with AST interpreter and it's own context free grammar. However, I will do it with the community. I want to discuss potential ideas to make this into something awesome, and I'm sure we can do something great with collaboration.
