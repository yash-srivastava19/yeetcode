## New Functionalities

Given the shabyness around this code, it heavily needs a revision. Revisions can be made of several types : 

- **Introducing New Macros :** This is what we need to do in the first revision. Create more ✨vibey✨ names, and be more clean and concise with the new functionalities. There is so much do be done in this regard.
- **New Language? :** Yeah, like every person ever, it would be great if we could make a new programming language out of it. We have to develop a grammar, make a custom parser, interpreter in Python and then we can yeet all what we want.

- For what it's worth, I will try to update whatever resources that I find useful here, for both cases. If you see something you want to contribute to, just open a PR and then we can discuss in lengths about it.
